# React Context to Redux Hooks Migration Plan

## Completed Steps

### 1. Cart State Migration

- ✅ Created Redux cart slice
- ✅ Implemented `useCart` hook
- ✅ Updated `CartItems` component to use hook
- ✅ Removed `CartContextProvider` from application
- ✅ Added test component for cart functionality

### 2. Products State Migration

- ✅ Created Redux products slice
- ✅ Implemented `useProducts` hook
- ✅ Updated product-related components to use hook
- ✅ Removed `ShopContextProvider` from application
- ✅ Added test component for products functionality

### 3. Auth State Migration

- ✅ Enhanced Redux user slice
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive `useAuth` hook
- ✅ Updated authentication protection components
- ✅ Updated authentication UI components
- ✅ Removed `AuthContextProvider` from application
- ✅ Added test component for auth functionality

## Current Status

All major context providers have been migrated to hooks:

- ✅ `CartContext` → `useCart`
- ✅ `ShopContext` → `useProducts`
- ✅ `AuthContext` → `useAuth`
- ⬜ `ErrorContext` → `useError` (Optional)

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Component Updates

- Update remaining components that might still use context directly:
  - Check Navbar and other site-wide components
  - Update product display components
  - Update checkout flow components

### 2. Testing and Bug Fixing

- Test all core user flows:
  - Product browsing and filtering
  - Cart functionality
  - Login/signup flow
  - Checkout process
- Fix any issues or regressions

### 3. Code Cleanup

- Remove unused context files once migration is complete
- Remove unused code and comments related to the old pattern
- Standardize error handling across hooks

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Implement memoization for expensive computations
- Review component re-renders and optimize further if needed
- Consider implementing selector functions for Redux state

### 5. Documentation

- Update project documentation to reflect new architecture
- Document hook APIs for future developers
- Add developer notes about migration decisions

## Optional Future Work

### 1. Error Context Migration

- Create Redux error slice if needed
- Implement `useError` hook
- Update error handling components

### 2. Advanced Features

- Implement offline support
- Add optimistic UI updates
- Consider request deduplication and caching

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Component Code**: Components no longer need to be wrapped in context providers
2. **Better Type Safety**: Hooks provide better TypeScript integration
3. **Improved Performance**: More granular control over re-renders
4. **Testability**: Hooks are easier to mock than context providers
5. **Consistency**: Unified pattern across the application
6. **Developer Experience**: More intuitive API for state management
