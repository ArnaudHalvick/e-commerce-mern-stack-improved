The frontend follows a structured, modular architecture:

```
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── pages/            # Full page components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── redux/            # State management
│   └── slices/       # Redux toolkit slices
├── api/              # API service layer
├── utils/            # Utility functions
└── stripe/           # Payment integration
```

### Component Structure

Components follow a consistent organization pattern:

```
component/
├── components/       # Sub-components
├── hooks/            # Component-specific hooks
├── styles/           # Component styling
