## Components

### AddProductPage

The main component that renders the product creation interface:

- Displays a create product card that launches the product creation modal
- Shows loading states during API operations
- Handles navigation after product creation

### CreateProductCard

A card component that initiates the product creation process:

- Displays a prominent "Create New Product" call-to-action
- Triggers the product creation modal when clicked

### ProductCreatedSuccess

A component that displays a success message after product creation:

- Shows product details of the newly created product
- Provides navigation options to:
  - Create another product
  - View the product in the product list
  - Edit the created product

## Custom Hooks

### useAddProduct

A custom hook that encapsulates the product creation logic:

- Manages the state of the creation process
- Handles form submission to the API
- Manages loading and error states
- Provides functions for:
  - Opening/closing the product edit modal
  - Creating new products
  - Handling creation success
  - Navigation after creation

## Integration with Other Components

The AddProduct page leverages these shared components:

1. **ProductEditModal**: Reused from `/components/productEditModal` for consistent product form experience
2. **ImageGallery**: Reused from `/components/imageGallery` for image management

## Workflow

1. User clicks "Create Product" on the create product card
2. ProductEditModal opens with empty form fields
3. User completes the product information form
4. On submission, the product is created via the API
5. On success, the ProductCreatedSuccess component is shown
6. User can choose to create another product or navigate to other sections

## Error Handling

The component implements comprehensive error handling:

- API errors are displayed with actionable messages
- Validation errors are shown inline with form fields
- Network errors prompt retry options
- Integration with the global error context for consistent error display
