# API Optimization Summary

## Problem

The API was sending too much unnecessary data, particularly review information, even for simple product listings.

## Solution

1. Created a smarter formatter (formatProductForResponse) that can:  
   - Include or exclude reviews based on need
   - Return only basic info for product listings
   - Return full details for product detail pages

2. Modified all API endpoints to accept query parameters:  
   - basicInfo=true/false - Controls whether to include full product details
   - includeReviews=true/false - Controls whether to include review data

3. Updated frontend components to:  
   - Request only basic info for listings (Popular, Related Products)
   - Request full details with reviews for product detail pages

4. Added dedicated review loading in the DescriptionBox component

## API Usage Examples

- List view: /api/featured-women?basicInfo=true
- Detail view: /api/products/[slug]?includeReviews=true
