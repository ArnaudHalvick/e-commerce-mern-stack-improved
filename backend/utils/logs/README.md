# Logs Directory

This directory serves as the storage location for application logs generated by the Winston logger configured in the common utilities.

## Purpose

- Stores log files in production environment
- Provides persistent storage of error logs for debugging
- Separates logs by severity for easier troubleshooting

## Log Files

When running in production mode, the following log files are automatically generated:

- **error.log** - Contains only error-level logs, helpful for critical issue tracking
- **combined.log** - Contains all log levels (error, warn, info, etc.)

## Configuration

Log settings are managed by the logger utility in `../common/logger.js`. The logs have the following characteristics:

- Maximum file size: 10MB per log file
- Log rotation: Up to 5 files for each log type
- Format: JSON format with timestamps in production for better parsing

## Access and Management

- Logs should be regularly archived for compliance and debugging purposes
- In production environments, consider setting up log shipping to a centralized logging service
- Sensitive information should never be logged in plain text (passwords, tokens, etc.)

## Note

This directory is automatically created by the logger utility if it doesn't exist. In development mode, logs are typically only output to the console and not written to files.
